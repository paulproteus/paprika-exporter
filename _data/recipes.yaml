  directions:
  - Oven Instructions
  - Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius)
  - Cut the brisket into approximately 1 inch sized cubes and season with salt and
    pepper
  - Place the oil in a large dutch oven/oven proof pot and once hot, work in batches
    searing the cubes of brisket on all sides. Once seared put the beef on a plate
    and set aside.
  - "Next add the garlic, onions and peppers to the pan and saut\xE9 for 5 minutes\
    \ until the onions become translucent. Add in the remaining ingredients including\
    \ the black beans and cooked beef and place the pot in the oven to cook for 3\
    \ hours."
  - After 3 hours, remove a piece of beef from the pot and test to see if its tender.
    It should easily shred with a fork. If cooked remove all of the beef from the
    pot and shred into pieces using 2 forks. Return the shredded brisket to the pot
    and stir.
  - Serve the chili with any toppings of choice.
  - Slow Cooker Instructions
  - Cut the brisket into approximately 1 inch sized cubes and season with salt and
    pepper
  - Turn the slow cooker on sear/saute and add in the oil. Once hot, work in batches
    searing the cubes of brisket on all sides. Once seared put the beef on a plate
    and set aside.
  - "Next add the garlic, onions and peppers to the pot and saut\xE9 for 5 minutes\
    \ until the onions become translucent. Add in the remaining ingredients including\
    \ the cubed butternut squash, black beans and cooked beef and cook for 8 hours\
    \ on low or 4 hours on high."
  - Once done cooking, remove a piece of beef from the pot and test to see if its
    tender (it should easily shred with a fork). If cooked, remove all of the beef
    from the pot and shred into pieces using 2 forks. Return the shredded brisket
    to the pot and stir.
  - Serve the chili with any toppings of choice.

  directions:
  - Place dried chiles in a large saucepan over medium heat. Toast, stirring and flipping
    the chiles occasionally, until pliable, lightly puffed, and fragrant, about 4
    minutes. Add stock, raisins, and orange juice, and simmer, stirring occasionally,
    until chiles are fully hydrated and tender, about 15 minutes. Drain chiles and
    raisins, reserving water separately. Transfer chiles to a blender or hand blender
    cup. Add chipotles and their sauce. Blend until completely smooth.
  - "Heat oil in a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering.\
    \ Add onions and poblanos and cook, stirring frequently, until softened but not\
    \ browned, about 4 minutes. Add garlic, cumin, and dried oregano and cook, stirring\
    \ constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add pur\xE9ed chiles, soy sauce,\
    \ and Marmite, and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 30 seconds.\
    \ Add reserved chile soaking liquid, tomatoes, kidney beans, black beans, hominy,\
    \ and sweet potatoes. Stir to combine and season with salt to taste."
  - Bring to a boil over high heat, reduce to lowest heat, cover, and cook, stirring
    occasionally, until sweet potatoes are fully tender and flavor has developed,
    1 to 1 1/2 hours, adding more liquid as necessary if chili threatens to scorch.
  - When cooked, add vodka or bourbon and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt
    and whisk in masa in a slow steady stream until desired thickness is reached.
    For best results, allow chili to cool and refrigerate for at least one night and
    up to a week. Reheat to serve.
  - Serve, garnished with cilantro, chopped onions, scallions, avocado, lime wedges,
    and warm tortillas as desired.

  directions:
  - Rinse dry black-eyed pea beans, pick through, and discard any foreign objects.
    Add beans to a large bowl (Cuisinart 3qt) and cover with 3-4 inches of cold water
    (2 liters aka 8 cups). Let sit overnight (2 hours min I guess). Covered with a
    plate, so you can put the bacon meat chunks on that plate later.
  - Use a Dutch oven or similar large deep pan for the recipe.
  - Pan to 325F. Saute chopped bacon until brown and crispy (10 minutes - 15 min).
    Remove bacon meat chunks and set aside, leaving all fat in the pan. (Put meaty
    cutting board in dishwasher.)
  - Pan to 250F. Throw in the onions, celery, garlic, peppers/cayenne, thyme/Italian
    seasoning, and bay leaf, and saute for 10 min (stirring every 5 min) until the
    onions are wilted and aromatic. OK to cover if you like.
  - Pan to 195F. Pour in the water.
  - Drain the soaked beans, rinse, and place them in the pot. Add black pepper.
  - Allow to simmer, covered, for about 3 hours. The beans should be tender and the
    broth slightly creamy and not watery.
  - Add the greens & meat into the pot, and continue cooking for another 10 minutes
    or more, stirring occasionally.
  - Add more stock or water if the mixture becomes dry and thick.
  - Taste and adjust seasonings with salt, pepper, and Creole seasoning if needed.
    Serve over rice and garnish with chopped green onion.

  difficulty: ''
  directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 425.
  - Pat the chicken dry all over and in the cavity with paper towels. Use your fingers
    to separate the skin of the chicken on the breast side from the meat. Rub the
    entire chicken with the olive oil or melted butter, including underneath the skin
    on the breasts side.
  - Combine the salt, pepper, Italian seasoning and garlic powder in a small bowl.
    Sprinkle the seasoning mix generously over the chicken, in the cavity and underneath
    the skin on the breasts side.
  - Place the halved lemon and fresh herbs in the cavity of the chicken.
  - Place the cut onion, carrots and celery in the bottom of a 9x2x13 inch baking
    dish or a rack with an insert. Add the chicken broth or water, enough for a thin
    layer. (This helps to prevent the veggies from burning.)
  - Place the chicken on top of the vegetables (or in the rack insert), breast side
    up. **Use a piece of kitchen string or twine to tie the drumsticks together. Tuck
    the wings of the chicken underneath the chicken.**
  - Roast at 425 for 1 hour and 15 minutes, until the chicken reaches an internal
    temperature of 160. Baste with the pan juices one to two times in the last half-hour
    of cooking.
  - Remove the roasted chicken from the oven and baste again with the pan juices.
    Let the chicken rest for 10-15 minutes before carving. (You can tent it with aluminum
    foil so it retains its heat.)
  - Carve the chicken (see notes below for details) and serve warm with vegetables
    and extra pan juices.
  - "Place the chicken on a cutting board. Get a sharp carving knife or chef\u2019\
    s knife and a fork."
  - Slice the skin of the chicken between the leg and the body.
  - Now you can see the leg joint. Cut to remove the drumstick and the chicken thigh
    together in one piece. Repeat on the other side.
  - Separate the drumstick and the thigh by finding the joint and cutting along the
    drumstick to reach it, then piercing the joint to separate the two pieces. (You
    can wiggle the pieces and flip them over if that helps to locate the joint.) Repeat
    on the other side of the chicken.
  - "To remove the chicken breasts, position your knife just above the wing on the\
    \ side of the chicken. Cut horizontally in to where the breast used to meet the\
    \ leg. Repeat on the other side. Next, cut along both sides of the breastbone\
    \ of the chicken at the top. Cut straight down until you\u2019ve cleared the breast\
    \ bone then cut at an outward angle to meet your horizontal cut. This will pull\
    \ the breasts away from the rib cage. Slice the chicken breasts in half or in\
    \ thick slices, if desired."
  - Finally, remove the wings. Pull each wing out and away from the body then cut
    through the joint.
  - 'Serving tips: Carve the chicken and lay the pieces on a large platter. Use a
    slotted spoon to also scoop out and add the onions, carrots and celery to the
    platter. Spoon up some of the cooking juices from your pan and drizzle over all
    of the chicken and vegetables. Garnish your platter with fresh herbs and lemon
    slices or halves, for presentation, if desired.'
  - 'How to store leftover roasted chicken:'
  - "Once you\u2019ve carved the chicken, store any leftover pieces in a covered container\
    \ in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
  - You can also freeze leftover chicken for up to 5-6 months in a freezer safe plastic
    bag or container. Be sure to label and date your container.
  - "If you plan to reheat the chicken later, it helps to remove the chicken meat\
    \ from the bones before storing. It\u2019s easier to do when the chicken is warm\
    \ or room temperature versus cold. If you don\u2019t plan to eat it, it\u2019\
    s also easier to remove the chicken skin before you store it."

  name: Easy Whole Roasted Chicken
  notes: "Toaster oven: 425 non-convection. Check at 45 min.\n\nChicken: The recipe\
    \ calls for a 5 lb. whole chicken, but anywhere in the 4.5 to 6.5 lb range is\
    \ fine. I\u2019ve got notes on adjusting the cook time below.\n\nChicken prep:\
    \ Make sure to remove the giblets and any innards from the chicken and pat it\
    \ dry really well. Starting with a dry bird will help it crisp and brown nicely\
    \ in the oven.\n\nHerbs: Thyme is my go-to herb for stuffing into the cavity,\
    \ but parsley would work well, too. You could also use a mix of herbs if you like.\n\
    \nButter/oil: I\u2019ve tested this recipe using both melted butter and extra-virgin\
    \ olive oil. Both work great, so use whichever you prefer.\n\nBasting: It helps\
    \ to baste the chicken once or twice in the last half-hour of cooking. You don\u2019\
    t need more than that - and you don\u2019t want to open your oven repeatedly and\
    \ have the temperature drop. You can even get away with only basting it when you\
    \ pull it out of the oven, before it sits to rest, if you forget. (I have.)\n\n\
    Rest time: Make sure to let the chicken rest for at least 10-15 minutes before\
    \ carving it. This is crucial to making sure it retains its juices and they don\u2019\
    t run out. As always, I use and recommend using a digital thermometer to ensure\
    \ your chicken is properly cooked through. It should get to 160 before you remove\
    \ it from the oven and then it will continue to cook as it rests.\n\nHow to truss\
    \ a chicken: A simple truss for a baked whole chicken is to tuck the wings in\
    \ and underneath the chicken so they are secured. And then tie the drumsticks\
    \ together with a piece of kitchen string so they are held together. That's all\
    \ you really need to do, but here's a tutorial for a full truss if you're interested.\n\

  directions:
  - Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. Rinse the tofu, slice it into 1-inch-thick
    slabs, and lay them on the prepared baking sheet. Top with more towels. Press
    the tofu by placing a heavy book or cast iron skillet on top. Set aside for 30
    minutes.
  - Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the red and green cabbage with the carrots
    and toss with lime juice. Season with salt and pepper. In a separate small bowl,
    combine the cucumber slices, sugar, 1/4 cup of the rice vinegar, and red pepper
    flakes (if using). Cover both bowls and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes or
    until ready to serve.
  - Using your hands, crumble the tofu into a medium bowl. Add cornstarch and toss
    until evenly coated. Heat a thin layer of oil in a large wok or skillet over medium-high
    heat until shimmering. Add the tofu and cook until browned and crispy all over,
    turning and breaking up the pieces with a wooden spoon as it cooks. Use a slotted
    spoon to transfer the tofu to a plate.
  - "Add more oil to the pan, if necessary, and briefly saut\xE9 the garlic and ginger\
    \ until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the gochujang, brown sugar, soy sauce,\
    \ and remaining 1/2 cup rice wine vinegar. Cook until the sauce is thick enough\
    \ to coat the back of a spoon, about 2 minutes. Add tofu back to the pan and stir\
    \ until well coated. Sprinkle sesame seeds on top."
  - Top each tortilla with cabbage slaw. Spoon the tofu over the slaw and top with
    the pickled cucumbers. Serve.

  directions:
  - Place the rice in medium bowl (Cuisinart 1.5 qt) and add enough water to cover
    by 2 inches. Using a fork, swish to release any excess starch. Wait 20 minutes.
    Drain by pouring water off the side of the pan carefully.
  - Use the 2.5qt Ikea saucepan <https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/sensuell-saucepan-with-lid-stainless-steel-gray-70324548/>
  - Add 4 cups water (2x rice). Lid not fully on.
  - Set to 212F and cook un-preheated for 20 min. Do 210F if it's American rice rather
    than basmati.
  - 'Goal: All of the water is absorbed and the rice is tender. If the rice is still
    too firm, add a few more tablespoons of water and continue cooking for a few minutes
    more. Remove the pan from the heat and allow it to sit covered for 5 minutes.
    Fluff the rice with a fork.'
  - 'Optional freezing: This rice can be frozen in an airtight container for up to
    3 months. (Putting it in a flat layer in sealable plastic bags works well as it
    will take up less space in the freezer.) No need to thaw before reheating; remove
    it from the freezer and reheat in the microwave with 1 to 2 Tbsp. of water.'

  directions:
  - Cut potatoes into cubes and create [recipe:Parcooked potatoes]. Wait for them
    to be done.
  - Meanwhile, heat the oil in a skillet and [recipe:Oil toast spices] for a few minutes.
  - Next, drain the potatoes and add them to the skillet. Pan-fry them at 350F for
    4 minutes without moving them. Then, flip them and cook them for 3 more minutes.
    This probably takes 2x that time.
  - Now, chop the green beans into bite-size pieces and then add them to the skillet
    with the potatoes.
  - Tip in ground turmeric and chilli flakes and stir-fry all for 5 minutes. Make
    sure the beans are tender and cooked through but still a bit crunchy.
  - Finally, sprinkle the aloo beans with masala powder and drizzle with lime juice.
    Then, season with salt and pepper to taste.

  directions:
  - Testing with dutch oven and 1/2 recipe.
  - Preheat dutch oven at low intensity to 230F.
  - In one bowl, whisk together the eggs and milk.
  - In another bowl, stir together breadcrumbs, Parmesan cheese and Italian seasoning.
  - "Peel and rinse eggplant and cut into \u2153 inch rounds. Ignore salting instructions\
    \ in recipe."
  - Choose the cooking pot, and spread loosely 1/8th of the sauce in the bottom of
    the cooking pot.
  - Iteratively dip eggplant in egg mixture and then in the breadcrumbs. Create 3
    layers in the slow cooker of breaded eggplant & sauce & mozzarella, probably 3
    layers. Add remaining sauce.
  - Cook covered at 230F for 2 hours, testing after that much time. It will likely
    be watery, so probably 30 min at 230F after that uncovered.
  - If desired, top with fresh basil leaves.

  directions:
  - In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, heat the oil
    until it shimmers. Add the potatoes, carrot and onion and cook, stirring occasionally,
    until the vegetables are coated with oil, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the water and bring
    to a boil.
  - Add the beef and stir to combine. Bring to a simmer, and use a spoon or a mesh
    skimmer to skim off impurities that rise to the surface. (This will help you achieve
    a clearer broth, but the stew will taste great even if you cannot remove all of
    it.)
  - Add the sugar and cook until dissolved, about 2 minutes. Add the soy sauce, sake
    and mirin. Taste the broth, and add up to 1 tablespoon of additional sugar, if
    desired. Partially cover with a lid and cook over medium-low to medium heat, until
    the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
  - Remove the lid, and keep at a lively simmer until all the ingredients are very
    tender and the liquid has reduced a bit, 10 to 15 minutes. The finished dish should
    be the consistency of a stew. Serve hot or warm.

  directions:
  - Heat a large pot over medium heat. Once hot, add oil, onion, cumin, and one-third
    of the salt (1/4 tsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch
    size).
  - Add garlic, ginger, cilantro, and green chilies to a mortar and pestle and grind
    into a rough paste (or use a small food processor to pulse into a paste. Alternatively,
    just finely mince.) Then, add to the pan with the onions.
  - Next add ground coriander, chili powder, and turmeric and stir to coat. Add a
    little more oil at this point if the pan is looking dry.
  - "Next add pureed tomatoes and chickpeas and remaining salt (1/2 tsp as original\
    \ recipe is written). If the mixture looks a little too thick, add up to 1 cup\
    \ (240 ml) water (I added ~1/2 cup (120 ml) // amount as original recipe is written\
    \ // adjust if altering batch size). You\u2019re looking for a semi-thick soup\
    \ consistency at this point, as it will cook down into more of a stew."
  - Increase heat to medium high until it reaches a rolling simmer, then reduce heat
    to low or medium-low and maintain a simmer (uncovered) for 15-20 minutes, or until
    thick and stew-like. Stir occasionally.
  - "In the meantime, if you don\u2019t have garam masala seasoning, make your own\
    \ by adding (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch\
    \ size) 2 small dried red chilies, 1 tsp black peppercorns (or 1/2 tsp ground\
    \ black pepper), 1 tsp cumin seeds (or 1/2 tsp ground cumin), 1 tsp cardamom pods\
    \ (or 1/2 tsp ground cardamom), 1/2 tsp cloves (or 1/4 tsp ground cloves), and\
    \ 1/8 tsp nutmeg to a mortar and pestle or spice grinder and grind/mix into a\
    \ powder. Set aside."
  - When the chana masala is thickened and bubbly, taste and adjust seasonings as
    needed, adding more salt for saltiness, chili powder for heat, or a bit of coconut
    sugar for sweetness and to offset the heat of the chilies.
  - Remove from heat and add lemon juice and garam masala. Stir to mix, then let cool
    slightly before serving. Fresh cilantro and lemon juice make an excellent garnish.
    Chana masala can be enjoyed as a stew on its own, or it can be delicious with
    white or brown rice (see my favorite method here), or cauliflower rice. Lastly,
    my favorite is over roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli (see notes for instructions).
  - Leftovers will keep covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days, or in the freezer
    up to 1 month.

  directions:
  - Line the base of a 23cm / 9inch springform cake tin with baking parchment and
    grease its sides lightly with butter.
  - "Preheat the oven to 180\xB0C/160\xB0C Fan/gas mark 4/ 350\xB0F."
  - Beat the butter and sugar till pale and whipped, either by hand in a bowl with
    a wooden spoon, or using a freestanding mixer.
  - Mix together the almonds, polenta and baking powder, and beat some of this into
    the butter-sugar mixture, followed by 1 egg, then alternate dry ingredients and
    eggs, beating all the while.
  - Finally, beat in the lemon zest and pour, spoon or scrape the mixture into your
    prepared tin and bake in the oven for about 40 minutes.
  - It may seem wibbly but, if the cake is cooked, a cake tester should come out cleanish
    and, most significantly, the edges of the cake will have begun to shrink away
    from the sides of the tin. remove from the oven to a wire cooling rack, but leave
    in its tin.
  - Make the syrup by boiling together the lemon juice and icing sugar in a smallish
    saucepan.
  - "Once the icing sugar\u2019s dissolved into the juice, you\u2019re done."
  - Prick the top of the cake all over with a cake tester (a skewer would be too destructive),
    pour the warm syrup over the cake, and leave to cool before taking it out of its
    tin.
  - ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
  - 'NOTE: To make this cake gluten-free, make sure to use gluten-free baking powder,
    or omit the baking powder altogether and beat the batter exuberantly at step 4.'
  - To make this cake dairy-free, substitute 150ml light and mild olive oil for the
    200g of butter, making sure you still whisk the oil and sugar together very well
    in step 3.
  - 'MAKE AHEAD:'
  - The cake can be baked up to 3 days ahead and stored in an airtight container in
    a cool place. Will keep for a total of 5-6 days.
  - 'FREEZE:'
  - The cake can be frozen on its lining paper as soon as cooled, wrapped in a double
    layer of clingfilm and a layer of foil, for up to 1 month. Defrost for 3-4 hours
    at room temperature.

  directions:
  - Pan to 230F for this
  - Over medium heat in a saucepan, heat the milk with the stock and salt, stirring
    throughout. Continue to heat the milk mixture over medium heat, and then reduce
    to low heat once the milk has begun to froth or simmer.
  - Next, in a second saucepan, heat the butter until melted. Stir in the flour. Reduce
    the heat to low and stir until well incorporated. Remove from the heat when it
    is a pale tan color (a blond roux).
  - Once the roux has thickened, slowly stir into the milk mixture to blend. Continue
    to stir over low heat until well incorporated. Finally, remove from the heat and
    whisk in the cheeses. Once mixed, add the pasta, again stir well and serve.

  directions:
  - Coat poblanos in a thin layer of neutral oil.
  - Oven to 400F.
  - Place 6ish poblanos on tray. Don't crowd, but OK to fill the tray. Cook 10 min.
  - Flip to other side. Cook 10 min. You should see char on both sides.
  - Flip to other side again if needed. Seems like another 10 min (30 total) does
    the job.
  - The pepper should be cooked everywhere & charred on all sides. https://i0.wp.com/www.artfuldishes.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/roasting-peppers-4.jpg?w=966&ssl=1
  - Repeat another 10-20 min if needed.
  - Remove and place in covered bowl so it can steam itself.
  - When cooled (e.g. 30 min, shorter may not give the skin more time to separate),
    use your fingers or a paper towel to rub off the outer skin. Chop and either use
    or store.

    The skin didn''t come off crazy easy; maybe the brown paper bag trick really is

    The oven might just be a better bet?'

  difficulty: Easy
  directions:
  - "Heat the oven to 180\xB0C/160\xB0C fan/350\xB0F/Gas 4."
  - 'Make the sponge. Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt in a medium
    mixing bowl and set aside. '
  - "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the beater attachment, cream together\
    \ the butter and sugar on medium speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl as\
    \ necessary, until the sugar has dissolved in the butter and the mixture is light\
    \ and fluffy (about 3\u20135 minutes). (Alternatively, you can do this by hand\
    \ in a bowl, using a wooden spoon.) "
  - Beat in the vanilla extract, then beat in the eggs one at a time, making sure
    each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next and scraping down the sides
    of the bowl as necessary. Add a tablespoon of the flour mixture if it looks as
    though the egg and butter mixture has split and mix again.
  - Add one third of the dry ingredients to the wet and mix until just incorporated,
    then add half of the milk. Mix until just incorporated. Beat in another third
    of the dry ingredients, then the remainder of the milk. Finally, add the rest
    of the dry ingredients. (Scrape down the bowl as needed.)
  - 'Divide the batter equally between the two prepared tins. Smooth the top with
    a palette knife or the back of a spoon to create an even layer with a level surface. '
  - "Bake the sponges in the centre of the oven for 20\u201325 minutes, or until lightly\
    \ browned and starting to pull away from the sides of the tin. The sponges should\
    \ spring back when you press them lightly in the centre. "
  - "Remove from the oven and leave the sponges to cool in the tins for 5 minutes,\
    \ then turn them out onto a wire rack to cool completely. (It\u2019s important\
    \ they are cooled fully before you start to decorate.)"
  - 'Spoon the jam on top of one of the sponges and spread it out with a knife in
    an even layer. '
  - 'Pour the cream into a mixing bowl, or into the stand mixer fitted with the whisk,
    and lightly whip the cream to soft peaks. '
  - "Dollop the cream on top of the jam and gently spread it out into an even layer.\
    \ Top with the second sponge and dust with icing sugar \u2013 serve and enjoy!"

  directions:
  - In a large Dutch oven, heat 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil over medium-high heat until
    shimmering. Season chicken all over with salt. Working in batches, sear chicken
    until browned on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer chicken to a platter,
    then set aside until cool enough to handle. Once chicken has cooled, shred into
    bite-size pieces.
  - Add sliced andouille to pot and cook, stirring, until lightly browned, about 6
    minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a platter and set aside.
  - "Add remaining 1 cup (235ml) oil to Dutch oven along with flour, stirring to form\
    \ a paste. Lower heat to medium-low and cook, stirring and scraping frequently,\
    \ until roux is a chestnut or chocolate-brown color but not scorched, about 1\
    \ hour. Alternatively, you can combine the flour and 1 cup oil in a separate ovenproof\
    \ vessel and cook, uncovered, in a 350\xB0F (180\xB0C) oven, stirring occasionally,\
    \ until roux is chestnut or chocolate-brown, about 4 hours, though how long this\
    \ will take can vary dramatically depending on your oven. You can add the finished\
    \ oven roux to the pot on the stovetop after removing the sausage, then immediately\
    \ proceed to the next step of saut\xE9ing the aromatics."
  - Add onion, bell pepper, and celery and season lightly with salt. Cook over medium-high
    heat, stirring and scraping, until softened, about 10 minutes; lower heat to medium
    if any of the ingredients threaten to scorch.
  - Stir in garlic, cayenne, and a generous amount of black pepper and cook, stirring,
    for 2 minutes longer.
  - Add stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Season lightly with salt. Bring to a gentle
    simmer, then allow to cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, for 1 hour. Add okra,
    if using, along with sausage and shredded chicken, and gently simmer, uncovered,
    for 1 hour longer. Skim any fat from the surface as it accumulates.
  - "Remove from heat and add fil\xE9 powder, if using, stirring well to break up\
    \ any small lumps. Season gumbo with salt. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaves."
  - "Serve gumbo with warm rice, sprinkling sliced scallions on top of each bowl.\
    \ Pass hot sauce at the table, as well as fil\xE9 powder, if desired, to lightly\
    \ shake on top of each serving of gumbo and rice."

  directions:
  - Rinse lentils and kidney beans until water runs clear, approx 5 times. Soak (in
    tests, soaked for 8 hours). Drain.
  - 'Start lentil boil:'
  - Boil 5 cups water. Put into stock pot (tested with Instant Pot vessel). Set temp
    to 212F.
  - Add lentils, kidney beans, whole spices, ginger, and chilis. Cook for 2 hours
    at 208F (very gentle simmer). At 30 min, skim foam. Every 30 min, mix gently to
    avoid lentils sticking to bottom of pot.
  - 'Prepare tadka:'
  - Can be delayed or done ASAP.
  - Frying pan to 380F. Add ghee. When hot, add cumin seeds; cook 2 min.
  - Pan to 310F; add onion; cook til barely browning, around 10 min, stirring every
    1-2 min.
  - Pan to 350F. Add ginger and garlic. Cook until raw smell vanishes, about 3 min
    (this time is untested).
  - Pan to 260F. Add tomatoes. Cook about 20 min (until they look like tomato paste),
    stirring every 3 min.
  - Add butter and deggi mirch. Allow to rest.
  - 'Finish dal:'
  - Remove whole spices if possible. Gently mash with a potato masher, just enough
    to slightly thicken.
  - Add tadka. Add ingredients from tadka part 2.
  - Add 3 tbsp heavy cream (we didn't measure this when doing the initial batch).
  - Allow to rest. We rested it one day in the fridge when testing the recipe. It
    was better after three days.
  - Serve with julienned ginger and a sprinkle of garam masala over rice, preferably
    with a veggie.

  directions:
  - "Adjust oven racks to upper and lower-middle positions and preheat oven to 350\xB0\
    F (180\xB0C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with paper towels. Spread chickpeas on\
    \ top and roll around under your hands to thoroughly dry. Transfer chickpeas to\
    \ a large bowl. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, cumin, and paprika. Season to taste\
    \ with salt and pepper. Discard paper towels and line baking sheet with aluminum\
    \ foil. Spread chickpeas over foil and transfer to oven. Roast on upper rack,\
    \ shaking pan occasionally, until chickpeas are about 3/4 their original size\
    \ with a dense, nutty texture, about 1 hour. Remove from oven and let cool slightly."
  - Meanwhile, add kale to now-empty chickpea bowl. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, season
    with salt and pepper, and massage kale until well-coated in oil. Set aside at
    room temperature.
  - Place pine nuts in a skillet and transfer to lower rack of oven. Toast, stirring
    occasionally, until pine nuts are deep golden brown, about 15 minutes. Remove
    from oven and transfer to a bowl. Set aside.
  - In a medium bowl, combine sun-dried tomatoes, scallions, garlic, lemon juice,
    zest, hot sauce, vinegar, and remaining 3 tablespoons oil. Season with salt and
    pepper and stir well with a fork.
  - When chickpeas are cooked and slightly cooled, add to bowl with kale. Add pine
    nuts, sun-dried tomato dressing, cilantro, and mint. Toss with hands until well-combined.
    Adjust seasoning with more salt, pepper, and/or lemon juice as necessary.
  - The massaged kale with sun-dried tomato vinaigrette keeps very well in the fridge,
    retaining its crunch and developing flavor over a couple days. Store in an airtight
    container in the fridge. Before serving, add the roasted chickpeas, pine nuts,
    cilantro, and mint. Toss gently until well-combined.

  directions:
  - Melt butter in a medium pot or large saucepan over medium heat. Add flour and
    cook for 1 minute.
  - Add about 3/4 cup of milk and mix into butter mixture - it will become a slurry
    pretty quickly.
  - Add remaining milk and mix so the slurry mixes in. Then add water and Seasonings.
  - Add macaroni and mix. Stir occasionally as it comes to heat. When you see wisps
    of steam as you stir, lower the heat down to medium low.
  - Stir regularly as it cooks for 9 - 10 minutes (it will bubble gently), or until
    the sauce thickens and the macaroni is just cooked - tender but still firm. It
    should still be saucey at this stage and thinner than you want.
  - Take it off the stove and stir the cheese in quickly. Adjust salt and pepper to
    taste. <- In this step, the sauce thickens and reduces considerably.
  - Serve immediately!!

  directions:
  - Instant Pot instructions
  - Place all ingredients into an Instant Pot in the order listed, EXCEPT for the
    butter, cream and 1 teaspoon of the garam masala, mixing the sauce well before
    you place the chicken on top of the sauce. If it's frozen, push it into the sauce
    a bit so it defrosts better
  - Close the cooker and set for 10 mins on high, and let it release pressure naturally
    for 10 minutes. After that, release all remaining pressure.
  - Open up the pot and remove the chicken carefully and set aside
  - Blend together all the ingredients, preferably using an immersion blender
  - Add the cut up butter, cream, cilantro, and garam masala and stir until well incorporated.
  - It's best to let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the
    cream. Adding it into the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that
    happens, just put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should
    be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon
  - Take out half the sauce and freeze for later or store in the fridge for 2-3 days
  - Add the chicken back in and heat through. Break it up into smaller pieces if you
    need but don't shred it.
  - Serve over rice, or zucchini noodles
  - Using leftover sauce
  - Use leftover cooked chicken and mix in with the gently heated sauce, let it simmer
    for a few for the flavors to meld together and there you go. Add some fresh cilantro
    on top.
  - You could also use this for Paneer Makhani. Defrost a cup of peas and 1 cup of
    paneer and mix gently into the heated sauce and let it simmer for a few for the
    flavors to meld together and there you go.
  - Watch The Video
  - If you use a stand blender, be very careful with the hot sauce and be sure to
    leave the inside lid open to vent.
  - Yes, I know the recipe doesn't call for additional liquid. The chicken and tomatoes
    release a LOT of liquid. Unless you do something wrong, it will not burn.
  - Do not re-pressure cook the butter and cream filled sauce for a second time as
    it gets thin and unappetizing. Cook the chicken when you first make the sauce,
    save half the tomato sauce frozen, and when you're ready, add cooked chicken,
    or paneer, and heat it through in a skillet. Instant dinner!
  - For this recipe, the garam masala is very, very, important. Unlike other recipes,
    I didn't use whole spices because I've learned that not everyone has whole cinnamon
    sticks, whole cloves, and green cardamom lying around. So we'll use garam masala
    instead and I must urge you to make this homemade garam masala recipe! It makes
    a HUGE difference.
  - You'll note there's no added water in this recipe. Between the tomatoes and the
    chicken, there's more than enough to create pressure in this recipe. Any more
    water and it's going to taste insipid.
  - Let the sauce cool just a little before adding the butter and the cream. Adding
    it to the boiling sauce will make your sauce very thin. If that happens, just
    put it in the fridge for a little and let it thicken up. It should be thick enough
    to coat the back of a spoon.

    For Neapolitan style - preheat pan to really hot, like 600 he does, then kill
    heat to the pan; add dough at that point; once it starts to puff, broil in oven.
    He puts a baking steel under the pan while in the oven so the bottom gets some

  directions:
  - Make the kadhi
  - To a large bowl, add 1/2 cup besan (55 grams) and 1.5 cups (360 grams) yogurt.
    Make sure the yogurt is at room temperature.
  - Whisk until besan and yogurt are well combined.
  - Add 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder and 1 teaspoon
    coriander powder and whisk until you have a lump free mixture.
  - Add 6 cups water (around 1.4 liters of water) and mix until it's all mixed together.
    Set aside.
  - In a large and deep pan, add 2 tablespoons of mustard oil on medium-high heat.
    You can use any oil but mustard oil gives it a nice flavor.
  - Once the oil is hot (make sure oil is heated through else mustard oil gives a
    raw taste), add the methi seeds and cumin seeds. Let them splutter and then add
    hing.
  - Add the sliced onion along with chopped green chili and cook for 2 minutes.
  - Then add the chopped ginger and garlic and cook for another 1 minute or so until
    the ginger and garlic start changing color.
  - Add the prepared besan-yogurt mixture into the pan. Now with heat on medium-high,
    stir continuously until the kadhi comes to a boil.
  - Stir continuously until the kadhi comes to a boil, then lower the heat to low-medium
    and let it cook for around 30 minutes. Keep stirring it in between.
  - Add salt after the kadhi has been cooking for 15 minutes or so. While the kadhi
    is cooking, make the pakora.
  - Make the pakora
  - To a large bowl, add 1 cup besan (110 grams), along with 1 cup sliced onion, 1
    chopped green chili, 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, 1/4 teaspoon turmeric, 1/8 teaspoon
    red chili powder, 1/2 teaspoon coriander seeds, 1/4 teaspoon ajwain and 1/2 teaspoon
    salt.
  - Add 2 tablespoons yogurt and mix.
  - t should not be very runny but not super thick either. I added around 1/4 cup
    and 2 tablespoons water.
  - Add 2 pinch of baking soda and mix the batter for a minute using your hands. This
    will make the pakoras nice and soft.
  - Meanwhile heat oil (around 2 cups) in a kadai on medium heat to fry the pakoras.
  - Once the oil is hot, mix the batter again for a minute using your hands and then
    start dropping the batter into the hot oil.
  - I take handful of batter using my thumb and four fingers and drop is straight
    into hot oil, you may use a spoon.
  - Let it cook and turn golden brown from one side and then flip and cook the other
    side. Make sure to cook on medium-low heat so that the pakoras cook nicely from
    inside too.
  - Cook until pakoras are golden brown from both sides. Drain on a paper towel.
  - After 30 minutes or so, kadhi would have considerably thickened and completely
    cooked. Add cilantro. You can little extra water here if kadhi looks too thick
    to you.
  - Add the pakora and transfer kadhi into a serving pan.
  - Make the tadka
  - Heat ghee in a small pan on medium heat. Once ghee is hot, add 1/4 teaspoon cumin
    seeds and generous pinch of ajwain. Add 2-3 dried red chilies (you can break them
    for extra heat).
  - Once seeds crackle, add 1/2 teaspoon kashmiri red chili powder and turn off the
    heat immediately.
  - Pour tadka over kadhi, garnish with more cilantro and serve punjabi kadhi pakora
    with rice!

  directions:
  - Pat sablefish dry. Sprinkle fillets on both sides with salt and pepper.
  - Allow fillets to rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes. (Cold fish is
    more difficult to sear.)
  - Add olive oil and half the butter to a heavy pan. Melt butter over medium heat.
  - Place the fillets skin-side down in the pan and cook about 4 minutes, depending
    on the thickness of the fillets.
  - As the sablefish cooks, the flesh will begin to turn opaque from the bottom up.
    When the fish has cooked halfway through, it's ready to flip.
  - Avoid touching the fish until the fish is ready to flip.
  - Use a thin metal spatula to test the fish. If you can slide the spatula under
    the fish without the fish sticking to the pan, it's ready to flip. If the fillets
    won't release, give them another 30 seconds. They'll release when they've finished
    cooking.
  - Cook fish about 4 minutes until done. Timing will depend on the thickness of the
    fillet. (Watch the sides of the fillets to see when the fish is done cooking.
    It's finished as soon as there are no more translucent patches and it's fully
    opaque.)
  - "Transfer the fish to plates, leaving the excess butter in the pan. Cover fish\
    \ to keep warm, or set fish in a 200\xBAF oven."
  - Reduce heat to medium-low. Add the remaining butter to the pan. The butter will
    begin to foam, and then the foam will begin to subside.
  - Watch for brown specks to appear in the butter and for the butter to start smelling
    nutty. As soon as it begins to become golden (about 1 minute), add the lemon juice,
    stir, and then remove from heat.
  - Pour the butter sauce into a small bowl and mix with the honey and cayenne.
  - Brush the butter sauce over the fish. You'll see that the sablefish is incredibly
    soft and the flakes will be pulling apart, so the sauce will soak down into the
    fish.
  - Serve the fish right away along with any extra sauce.

  directions:
  - 'Chicken Adobo Method:'
  - In a large bowl, add in all the chicken (thighs and drumsticks) and the heavily
    crushed cloves of garlic.
  - To that add a fresh crack of black pepper, black peppercorns, palm sugar, unseasoned
    rice vinegar, dark soy sauce, regular soy sauce, filtered water, and toss together
    and add in bay leaves.
  - Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge for 2 hours, or ideally overnight.
    **Reserve all marinated liquid**
  - Set a large braiser or dutch oven over medium-high heat and coat with oil to cover
    the pan.
  - Sear all the chicken in batches on all sides for 2-3 minutes per side. Place each
    batch to the side once done browning to avoid overcrowding. 400F
  - Add marination to the pan (without the chicken) along with all the aromatics.
    Increase the heat to medium-high and add the chicken pieces to the pan in layers
    and bring to a boil.
  - Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let simmer (covered) for 35
    minutes. Uncover and flip the chicken pieces, cover them again, and cook for another
    25-35 more minutes. Turn chicken over occasionally to thoroughly coat and the
    sauce thickens and a glaze.
  - Place the chicken on a plate of rice topped with green onions. Spoon on as much
    sauce as desired.
  - 'Leftover Potsticker Method:'
  - To a large bowl, add sliced cabbage, salt and crush with hands then add thinly
    sliced green onions and toss together.
  - Add in the leftover chicken (no bones!). Toss together to combine.
  - Drizzle a couple of spoonfuls of the glaze. Mix together to combine
  - Fill gyoza wrappers with the chicken mixture (about 2 tsp).
  - Wet the edges, fold like a taco, pinch in the center, and pleat each side starting
    with the center. 3 total pleats. Repeat until all the filling is used.
  - Heat a nonstick skillet over medium heat, add just enough oil to coat the bottom
    pan (about 2 Tbsp).
  - "Once hot, arrange the gyozas around the pan making sure they don\u2019t touch.\
    \ Let them cook and brown for 2 minutes."
  - Add water, immediately cover with a lid and let steam for 3 minutes.
  - Remove lid and if any liquid remains let simmer until completely gone.
  - Let rest for 1 minute and plate. Cover with chili oil.

  directions:
  - Drain chickpeas and place in a large pot with bay leaf, carrot, onion, and the
    segmented celery stalk. Cover with cold water by 2 inches, season with salt, bring
    to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until the chickpeas are tender but still
    hold their shape, about 1 hour. Discard bay leaf, carrot, onion, and celery. Drain
    and rinse under cold running water until chilled. Let drain in a colander set
    in the sink while you prepare the rest of the salad.
  - Combine cumin and vinegar in a large bowl. Whisking constantly, slowly drizzle
    in olive oil. Add shallot, sliced celery, parsley leaves, and drained chickpeas.
    Toss to coat with dressing and season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately,
    or for better results, store overnight in a covered container in the refrigerator.
    Salad will keep for up to three days.

  name: Oven roasted veggies (root, or squash/pumpkin/zucchini/eggplant)
  notes: Trying one bag of colorful cauliflower, 340 g, toaster oven, preheat convection,
    325 Fahrenheit, 20 minutes. Difficult to get the oil to mix nicely, so maybe it
    would make sense to do half the time, half the oil, toss in the rest of the oil
    as part of mixing stuff around in the middle. https://feelgoodfoodie.net/recipe/how-to-roast-frozen-vegetables/
    says pan contact helpful & preheat pan & higher temp might be smart. TBD. What
    I did was put another 4 mL of oil onto the veggies at minute 12 (total planned
    cook 30). Needed 45 min total; came out good over all.

  directions:
  - Set your slow cooker to high, and pour in a couple tablespoons of olive oil while
    you prep your ingredients. This will allow the oil to pre-heat a little bit.
  - Add the potatoes, onions, chili, ginger, garlic and spices to the slow cooker.
    Stir through to coat everything with the spices and oil.
  - "Allow to cook for 1 to 1 and 1/2 hours, stirring a couple times throughout. The\
    \ spices will become fragrant and the ginger, chili and garlic will start to cook\
    \ and crisp. (If you know your slow cooker\u2019s heat is on the higher side,\
    \ you might wish to turn the setting to Low for this portion.)"
  - Add the remaining ingredients (the spinach, vegetable stock, tomatoes and spinach).
    The spinach will quickly start to wilt so be sure to give it a stir to get everything
    mixed together once that starts to happen.
  - Leave cooking for another 2 to 3 hours, until the potatoes are tender.

  directions:
  - Making Tamarind Pulp
  - Soak the tamarind in hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.
  - Once the tamarind gets soft, then squeeze the tamarind in the water itself. Discard
    the strained tamarind and keep the tamarind pulp aside.
  - Cooking Lentils
  - Rinse tuvar dal a couple of times in water.
  - "Drain all the water and add the dal in a 2 litre pressure cooker. Also add \xBC\
    \ teaspoon turmeric powder."
  - Add 1.5 to 1.75 cups water and mix. Cover and pressure cook dal for 7 to 8 whistles
    or 9 to 10 minutes on medium heat.
  - When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and check the dal. The
    dal should be completely cooked and mushy.
  - Mash the dal with a spoon or wired whisk. Cover and keep aside. You can see the
    consistency of dal in the pic below.
  - Cooking Vegetables
  - "When the dal is pressure cooking \u2013 rinse, peel and chop the vegetables."
  - Take the chopped vegetables in a pan or pot. Also add 6 to 7 pearl onions or 1
    small to medium onion (thickly sliced) and 1 small to medium tomato (quartered).
  - Sprinkle turmeric powder, kashmiri red chilli powder and salt as per taste. Adding
    kashmiri red chili powder is optional and can be skipped.
  - Add 1.5 to 2 cups water and stir.
  - Keep the pan on a stove top and begin to cook vegetables on a medium-low to medium
    flame. In between do check when the vegetables are cooking.
  - "Cook till the vegetables are almost done. Ensure that you don\u2019t over cook\
    \ the vegetables."
  - Making Sambar
  - Once the vegetables are almost cooked, then add the tamarind pulp and 1 to 1.5
    tablespoons sambar powder. Mix well.
  - Add the mashed dal. Mix again very well.
  - Simmer on a medium-low heat till the sambar comes to a boil.
  - You will see a frothy layer on top when the sambar begins boiling. At this step
    switch off the heat. Cover and set aside.
  - Tempering
  - "In a small pan or tadka pan, heat 2 tablespoons gingelly oil. Add \xBD tsp mustard\
    \ seeds."
  - Let the mustard seeds crackle.
  - Then add 1 to 2 dry red chillies (halved and seeds removed).
  - Immediately add 10 to 12 curry leaves, 5 to 6 methi seeds and 2 pinches of asafoetida
    (hing). Be careful as the oil splutters while adding curry leaves.
  - Fry them till the red chilies change color and curry leaves become crisp.
  - Immediately add this tempering mixture in the hot sambar.
  - Cover the pan with its lid for 4 to 5 minutes, so that the aroma and flavors from
    the tempering mixture gets infused with the sambar.
  - Storage And Leftovers
  - Store any leftovers in the refrigerator for a day only. Note that the consistency
    will thicken after refrigeration. Add some water and mix to get your desired consistency
    while reheating in a pan.

  name: Sambar Recipe | Authentic South Indian Sambar
  notes: 'Sambar Powder: The sambar powder can make or break your sambar. Use the
    best sambar powder. It can be homemade or from your favorite brand. Sambar powder
    is easily available online.


    Vegetables: The mix of various vegetables add plenty of their unique flavor and
    taste to sambar. Thus depending on the type of vegetables used, your sambar recipe
    will taste different every time. I prefer to add a mix of drumsticks, brinjals,
    pumpkin or ash gourd, pearl onions (shallots), carrots and okra. Feel free to
    mix and match the veggies from the list mentioned in the post.


    Lentils: Try to use fresh and preferably unpolished tuvar dal for best flavor
    and health reasons. The fresher the dal is the better it tastes and cooks faster.
    For faster cooking, you can opt to soak the lentils in water for 30 to 60 minutes.


    Cooking Lentils: The lentils can be cooked in an Instant Pot or pan on the stove
    top. Add water as needed. The lentils should be softened and mushy.


    Tamarind: I suggest to use fresh tamarind. If you use aged tamarind, then it will
    be darker in color and more sour. So add a bit less of the dark tamarind than
    what is mentioned in this recipe.


    Cooking Vegetables: Always cook the vegetables till they are done but whole. They
    should not break or become a mush in the sambar. So when cooking, add vegetables
    which cook slower first and cook them for some minutes. Then add vegetables which
    cook faster. Note that The vegetables can also be steamed in a steamer or pressure
    cooker or Instant pot.'

  directions:
  - 'Prepare brown butter: Pan to 310F (probe control around 250F); add butter; remove
    when milk solids are a brown color and smell nutty, about 7-12 minutes. Let cool
    in a separate bowl/storage vessel for at least an hour in the fridge. Then bring
    to room temperature.'
  - "Toast the pistachios: Pan to 248F; toast pistachios until fragrant and lightly\
    \ brown, about 10-20 minutes, stirring every 5 min. Set aside to let cool. Put\
    \ in a large plastic bag and use a rolling pin to \u201Cgrind\u201D the pistachios\
    \ until they are quite fine (you can also chop them but I find this a lot easier)."
  - 'Prepare dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, combine flour, pistachios (reserve
    2 tablespoons for topping), cardamom, and salt.'
  - 'Make cookie batter:'
  - Place room temperature butter with the white sugar in bowl of standing mixer with
    paddle attachment. Cream with stand mixer at medium power until lighter in color.
    Or do it with your hands and a fork.
  - Add in egg yolks, salt, and vanilla with stand mixer at medium power. Or do it
    with your hands and a fork.
  - Add dry ingredient mixture gradually into the butter mixture with the mixer on
    low speed and mix until combined.
  - 'Shape the cookies:'
  - The dough may be crumbly at this phase; that is OK.
  - "For diamonds, roll out dough into a 1/2\u2019\u2019 thick square."
  - For circle/squares (easier method), place dough on parchment paper and using the
    parchment paper, shape dough into a log. Cover with plastic wrap and place in
    fridge. See web page for a visual!
  - 'Chill the cookies:'
  - Chill in fridge for at least 30 minutes, up to a few days You can freeze the cookie
    log at this point; if you do that, defrost it for 1 day in the fridge moving onto
    the next step.
  - 'Cut:'
  - Slice cookies into design of your choice.
  - For diamonds, using a small knife or pastry wheel and cut at angles. See web page
    for a visual.
  - "For circle/squares, slice the log into 1/4\u2019\u2019 thick slices (remember,\
    \ 26 cookies)."
  - 'Bake:'
  - Place cookies onto baking sheet. They can be close together, because they will
    not spread. You can sprinkle a bit of turbinado sugar on top if you are not doing
    the icing.
  - Bake 16-20 minutes at 350, until very lightly golden. Let cool completely before
    eating. They are a little crumbly/delicate, but will harden up and not be as crumbly
    once stored in the fridge for a few hours. Store in an airtight container for
    up to a week.

  directions:
  - "To prepare the collards: Cut out the thick center rib out of each collard green.\
    \ Stack the rib-less greens and roll them up into a cigar-like shape. Slice over\
    \ the \u201Ccigar\u201D as thinly as possible (\u215B\u2033 to \xBC\u2033) to\
    \ make long strands. Shake up the greens and give them a few chops so the strands\
    \ aren\u2019t so long."
  - Heat a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat, then add the olive
    oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add all of the collard greens and the salt.
  - Stir until all of the greens are lightly coated in oil, then let them cook for
    about 30 seconds before stirring again. Continue stirring in 30-second intervals
    until the greens are wilted, dark green, and some are starting to turn browns
    on the edges (this is delicious). This will take between 3 to 6 minutes.
  - "Once the collards are just about done, add the garlic and red pepper flakes (if\
    \ using). Stir to break up the garlic and cook until it\u2019s fragrant, about\
    \ 30 seconds. Remove the pan from the heat."
  - Immediately divide the cooked collards onto plates, and serve with a lemon wedge
    each.

  directions:
  - Large tall-sided skillet to 250F. Add oil; allow to come to temp.
  - Prep onions if not done yet. Add onions and 2 big pinches of salt. Cook 10 min
    covered, stirring every 2 min, so they become soft without getting too much color
    (browning in spots is fine).
  - While onions cook, prep peppers and garlic if not prep'd yet.
  - Add the peppers and garlic and 2 big pinches of salt. Cook covered for about 10
    minutes, stirring every 2 min; when the juices collect in the bottom of the pan,
    OK to remove cover. Peppers should soften without getting too much color.
  - Pan to 275F.
  - "After 5 minutes or so, or when the sound has turned from a steamy bubble to a\
    \ more crackling sizzle, you\u2019ll want to stir about 30 seconds to a minute,\
    \ to pick up any bits that have caramelized, and dissolve them back in."
  - After another 5 minutes, or when the peppers are very soft and spreadable and
    everything smells fantastic and sweet, move to the next phase.
  - Add the thyme and vinegar and cook, stirring, for 1 more minute. Taste, and add
    more salt or vinegar if desired.
  - Remove the peppers from the heat, and let cool.
  - Store, refrigerated, for up to 2 weeks. It tastes best at room temperature or
    warm.

  directions:
  - Drain chickpeas and place in a large pot with bay leaf, carrot, onion, and celery.
    Cover with cold water by 2 inches, season with salt, bring to a boil, reduce to
    a simmer, and cook until the chickpeas are tender but still hold their shape,
    about 1 hour. Discard bay leaf, carrot, onion, and celery. Drain and rinse under
    cold running water until chilled. Let drain in a colander set in the sink.
  - Meanwhile, adjust rack to 4 to 5 inches below broiler and preheat broiler to high.
    Place chiles on a foil-lined broiler pan and broil, turning occasionally, until
    completely blackened on all surfaces, about 15 minutes total. Crimp foil to seal
    around the chiles and set aside for 10 minutes.
  - Meanwhile, cook bacon in a medium skillet over medium-high heat, stirring frequently,
    until completely crisp. Remove from heat and stir in shallots and garlic. Immediately
    transfer to a large bowl. Add olive oil and 2 tablespoons lime juice and whisk
    to combine.
  - When chiles are cool enough to handle, peel using your fingers. Discard skin,
    stems, and seeds and slice flesh into thin strips.
  - When beans are cooked and drained, add to bacon mixture. Add chile strips, cotija,
    scallions, and cilantro and toss to combine. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
    Serve immediately with lime wedges, or for better results, store overnight in
    a covered container in the refrigerator. Salad will keep for up to three days.

  directions:
  - Dry fish skin with paper towels.
  - Scoring the skin is crucial. Cut about a half centimeter into the salmon, the
    long way. If you have a top loin cut that includes the thinner belly, score only
    the thicker (collar) portion.
  - Season the salmon with salt, making sure to get inside the areas that you scored.
  - Pan to 350F.
  - Oil into pan.
  - "Place the filets in the pan skin side down an away from you, so you don\u2019\
    t accidentally splash yourself with any hot oil."
  - You will probably see the salmon tighten up right away. Weigh the fish down with
    a small plate. Cook for 5-8 min.
  - Carefully flip the filets. Turn off the heat if using cast iron; if thin nonstick,
    pan to 300F. Cook for 2-3 min. It's done when the sides of the fish are just opaque
    and light pink in color and the internal temp approx 100F, but doneness is also
    to taste. Remove fish to a plate to rest.
  - "If continuing with greens, saut\xE9e them: stems first if there are stems, 350F,\
    \ 3 min. Add pepper as early as possible. Cook leaves until wilted but not mushy,\
    \ around 90 sec."
  - Put the greens on a plate and put the salmon on top. Juice the lemon (or pour
    lemon juice) over it. Serve.

  directions:
  - 'Process oranges:'
  - Using a Microplane, finely grate zest of 2 oranges; transfer zest to a food processor.
  - Using a sharp knife, remove pith from oranges and discard.
  - "Cut each orange into 6 pieces and transfer to food processor. Pulse until oranges\
    \ are blended into a coarse pur\xE9e with the texture of a thin marmalade, 6 to\
    \ 8 pulses. Note: If you don\u2019t have a food processor (or have one but prefer\
    \ not to use it), you can chop the oranges by hand after removing the pith."
  - Transfer mixture to a 2-quart saucepan.
  - 'Combine and cook the sauce:'
  - Add sugar, Cointreau (if using), salt, and cinnamon to saucepan and stir until
    well combined and sugar is hydrated. Add cranberries and gently stir to combine.
  - "Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally. Once mixture\
    \ reaches a simmer, cover saucepan, reduce heat to low to maintain a simmer, and\
    \ continue to cook until cranberries are softened and mixture has thickened slightly,\
    \ about 5 minutes. Remove lid and continue to cook uncovered, gently stirring\
    \ occasionally to make sure sauce doesn\u2019t scorch but also making sure not\
    \ to mash cranberries into a paste, until mixture reaches a loose, jam-like consistency,\
    \ about 5 minutes longer. Remove from heat."
  - 'Serve, or chill:'
  - "Transfer cranberry sauce to a serving bowl if using right away or to an airtight\
    \ container if you\u2019re preparing it in advance, and cool uncovered at room\
    \ temperature for 15 minutes."
  - Once cooled, either cover and refrigerate until ready to use or garnish and serve.
  - When ready to serve, garnish with pistachios and finely grate orange zest over
    top. Serve.

  directions:
  - Measure beans into a colander, pick out any dirt or pebbles, rinse and place in
    a 4 quart pan. Add 6 cups water, remove any beans that float, and let soak 4 -
    8 hours until you see no dry core when you break one open. Or quick soak beans
    by boiling them for one minute then let them stand off the fire for 1 hour then
    drain beans completely.
  - Cover beans with 6 cups fresh water in olla or pan, add the lard or other fat,
    onion and epazote (optional) and bring slowly to a simmer. Partially cover and
    simmer over medium low heat, stirring occasionally, until they are fully tender,
    1 to 2 hours. If you see the beans peeking up through the liquid, add hot water
    to cover then by 1/2"; without enough water, the beans may cook unevenly and tend
    to stick to the bottom.
  - Season with salt, remove the epazote, and the beans are ready to serve.

  directions:
  - Warm the olive oil in a large thick-bottomed pot over medium-high heat.
  - ' Stir in the salt and potatoes.'
  - ' Cover and cook until they are a bit tender and starting to brown a bit, about
    5 minutes - it''s o.k. to uncover to stir a couple times.'
  - ' Stir in the garlic and onion and cook for another minute or two. '
  - 'Add the stock and the beans and bring the pot to a simmer. '
  - Stir in the cabbage and cook for a couple more minutes, until the cabbage softens
    up a bit.
  - ' Now adjust the seasoning - getting the seasoning right is important or your
    soup will taste flat and uninteresting. '
  - "If salt isn\u2019t working, try some vinegar and pepper"
  - Taste and add more salt if needed, the amount of salt you will need to add will
    depend on how salty your stock is (varying widely between brands, homemade, etc)...
  - Serve drizzled with a bit of olive oil and a generous dusting of cheese.

  notes: 'If you use ghee it is probably too powerful in flavor. Try decreasing by
    2/3.


    When we test the recipe, we find it''s best if a pan only holds 1/2 lb to avoid
    crowding.


    Salt needs to be measured.


    I tried the bindi method for diced potatoes for home fries and 270F 40 min which
    is a while'
